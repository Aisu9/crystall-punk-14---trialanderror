## What is Spellblade?

Spellblade is a school of magic that focuses on empowering yourself via weapon summoning spells and enchanted weapon attack, and your teammates with weapon and armor enchantments.
(each weapon have a long lifetime, costly in mana and low-average to high-average damage, don't have durability and lock your hand(s) with it for the entire weapon duration)
and providing support to your team via temporary enchantment spells(improvement to weapon and armor stats).
Most spellblade spells cost a lot of mana compared to other school of magic, considering they bring long lasting bonuses to either yourself or others(5 minutes?).
